Changes to BC and behavior in version 4.5.0
===========================================

INI setting changes
-------------------

- content.ini[DataTypeSettings]AvailableDatatypes 

  Since 5.0 AvailableDataTypes can be defined with a pair of dataype/class and so take
  adventage of autoload mechanism reducing the number of file_exists and include calls.
  You should update those of your extensions defining datatypes accordingly.
  Ex: AvailableDatatypes[mycustom]=myCustomType

  Even this is now the recommended way to do it, the 'old' way is still valid.
  The main adventage is that you will gain some file_exists and include calls.
  You won't need to execute the eZDataType::register method from your dataype
  class either.

- workflow.ini[EventSettings]AvailableEventTypes 

  Since 5.0 AvailableEventTypes can be defined with a pair of eventype/class and so take
  adventage of autoload mechanism reducing the number of file_exists and include calls.
  You should update those of your extensions defining workflows accordingly.
  Ex: AvailableEventTypes[event_custom]=customType

  Even this is now the recommended way to do it, the 'old' way is still valid.
  The main adventage is that you will gain some file_exists and include calls.
  You won't need to execute the eZWorkflowEventType::registerEventType method
  from your workflow class either.


Change of behavior
------------------

- #019411: Avoid file_exists and include calls for registering datatypes and workflows

  Kernel datatypes and kernel workflow classes take now adventage of the autoload 
  mechanism. Autoload generator add these clasess to the autoload array, so there's no 
  need to do any of the file_exists or include calls.
